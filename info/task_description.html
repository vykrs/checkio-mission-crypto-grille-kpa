This is the fifth mission inspired by classical cryptography. In this mission we will attempt to break the Rotating Grille cipher. For more info on grille cipher check out missions <a href="https://py.checkio.org/mission/cipher-map2/">Cipher Map</a> and <a href="https://py.checkio.org/mission/rotating-grille-cipher/">Rotating Grille Cipher</a> - it's highly recommended that you've solved them before trying this one.

In cryptanalysis, <i>Known Plaintext Attack</i>, or <i>KPA</i>, is a mode of attack on a cipher where the analyst has access to both the ciphertext and to the corresponding plaintext; those can be used to derive the secret key and decipher all further messages encrypted with it. Some types of ciphers are very vulnerable to KPA: for instance, Caesar's cipher can be broken knowing just one pair of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext symbols; in other cases, finding the key requires a bit more work.

<p>
In this task we'll try to perform known plaintext attack on the rotating grille cipher. First, let's quickly go over the algorithm: the key to encryption is a square stencil with holes cut in it (in this mission we will use grille of size 8x8);  the sender places the grille on a sheet and writes the first 16 letters of the message; then, turning the grille 90 degrees clockwise, the second 16 are written, and so on until the grid is filled. To decrypt a message, receiver arranges the cryptogram in an 8x8 square, places the grille on top of it and reads the letters in the holes, rotating the grille when necessary.
</p>
<p>
You are given two strings of text: a message and a corresponding cryptogram; both strings are 64 characters long. You need to find and return the grille used to encrypt the message. Like previous missions, the grille is a list of strings where "X" means hole, "." means no hole.

<p>
Important note: each input in this task is guaranteed to have a single solution.
